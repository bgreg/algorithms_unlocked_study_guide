# Merge Sort

### Description

Merge sort is a sorting technique based on divide and conquer technique. With
worst-case time complexity being Ο(n log n), it is one of the most respected
algorithms. Merge sort first divides the array into equal halves and then
combines them in a sorted manner.

### Properties

1.  Stable
2.  Θ(n) extra space for arrays (as shown)
3.  Θ(lg(n)) extra space for linked lists
4.  Θ(n·lg(n)) time
5.  Not adaptive
6.  Does not require random access to data
